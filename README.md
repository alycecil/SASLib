General java utility library

#### Fair Warning
This is a bunch of random java classes that do things from path finding, to colision detection, to open gl rendering, to reimplementing BASIC functions, and its all crap code written by a stupider version of myself. Nothing in here is of any value.

Some classes may claim to be licensed under all kinds of different things from different stages of the pile; know that as of 31 August 2015 it is all licensed under CC0 and can be used freely for any purpose other than pattent or trademark claims by anyone. That being said you probably dont want to use it.
